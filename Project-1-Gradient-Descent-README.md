🌟 Gradient Descent Visualizer

A simple mathematical demonstration of how machines “learn” by reducing error.

🔍 What This Project Shows

This project visualizes gradient descent, the fundamental optimization algorithm used in:

machine learning

deep learning

AI systems

neural networks

It teaches how a “model” walks downhill on a curve to find the minimum error.

🧠 Concept (5-year-old friendly)

Imagine you are on a hill in fog.

You can’t see the top or bottom.

You feel the ground:

If it goes upward → step the opposite direction

If it goes downward → follow it

After many small steps, you reach the lowest point.

This is exactly how AI learns.

📈 Mathematics Behind It

We minimize this function:

f(x) = x² + 3x + 2


Its derivative:

f’(x) = 2x + 3


Gradient descent update rule:

x_new = x_old – learning_rate * f’(x_old)


The model keeps moving until slope ≈ 0.

🧪 What the Code Does

✔ Plots the curve
✔ Computes derivative
✔ Takes 25 steps downhill
✔ Shows the “walking path” with red dots
✔ Prints the minimum found

🧘‍♂️ Why This Project Matters (for PhD)

This project demonstrates:

understanding of optimization

ability to implement mathematical algorithms

ability to visualize learning dynamics

interest in mathematical foundations of machine learning

This is exactly what professors in applied math + ML want to see.
